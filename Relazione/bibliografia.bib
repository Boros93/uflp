abstract="In this paper, the uncapacitated facility location problem is considered. A tabu searchalgorithm for solving this problem is proposed. The algorithm is tested on some standardtest problems taken from literature and its performance is compared with the known optimalsolutions. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm produces optimal solutionsfor all test problems, and that it is very efficient in terms of time compared to existingalgorithms in the literature.",
