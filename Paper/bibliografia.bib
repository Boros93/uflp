abstract="In this paper, the uncapacitated facility location problem is considered. A tabu searchalgorithm for solving this problem is proposed. The algorithm is tested on some standardtest problems taken from literature and its performance is compared with the known optimalsolutions. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm produces optimal solutionsfor all test problems, and that it is very efficient in terms of time compared to existingalgorithms in the literature.",

abstract = "With emphasis on the simple plant location problem, (SPLP), we consider an important family of discrete, deterministic, single-criterion, NP-hard, and widely applicable optimization problems. The introductory discussion on problem formulation aspects is followed by the establishment of relationships between SPLP and set packing, set covering and set partitioning problems which all are among those structures in integer programming having the most wide-spread applications. An extensive discourse on solution properties and computational techniques, spanning from early heuristics to the presumably most novel exact methods is then provided. Other subjects of concern include a subfamily of SPLP's solvable in polynomial time, analyses of approximate algorithms, transformability of p-CENTER and p-MEDIAN to SPLP, and structural properties of the SPLP polytope. Along the way we attempt to synthesize these findings and relate them to other areas of integer programming."
